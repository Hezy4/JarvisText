Okay, I had some requests to add a Jarvis with keyboard input instead of voice, so here you are!

# This project took a year of work. Spread it around!
# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hezyhax/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
python3 -m pip install -r deps.txt
```
# Model Size
If your computer cannot handle huge loads, run:
```
python3 download_model.py 345M
```
If it is more equiped, run:

Then, you're ready to run Jarvis.
